# Labs

After getting up and running you might want to try your hand at some more advanced labs and tutorials. These labs provide you with a guides, tutorials and code samples and will help you work through building and deploying Flogo apps. The labs cover a wide range of topics like deploying to Kubernetes, using Flogo with the Serverless Framework and a bunch more! The colors of the cards have a meaning:

* The "_yellow_" cards emphasize building apps using the Flogo Web UI
* The "_red_" cards use external tools like Kubernetes or the Serverless Framework
* The "_blue_" cards have an emphasis on using the Flogo CLI.

  {{< bigcard img="../images/labs/034-experiment.svg" headercolor="bg2" text="Kubernetes is probably the most wellknown container orchestration platform out there. In this demo you explore how to run Flogo apps on Kubernetes. The demo will walk you through deploying two apps" href="./kubernetes">}}

  {{< bigcard img="../images/labs/009-scientific.svg" headercolor="bg1" text="Flogo runs perfectly on these small devices, and in this lab you'll build a sample to read and write data to the GPIO pins of the device to control your home lights!" href="./raspberry-iot">}}

  {{< bigcard img="../images/labs/009-scientific.svg" headercolor="bg1" text="A device shadow is a digital representation in the cloud that stores and retrieves current state information for a device. You can get and set the state of a device over MQTT or HTTP with AWS IoT!" href="./aws-iot">}}

  {{< bigcard img="../images/labs/047-safety-glasses.svg" headercolor="bg3" text="Project Flogo provides two different command-line interfaces and which you need depends on the task you need to execute. This tutorial covers the 'flogo' command" href="./flogo-cli">}}

  {{< bigcard img="../images/labs/047-safety-glasses.svg" headercolor="bg3" text="Serverless is all around us and perhaps the fastest growing market for compute. Flogo has first class support for AWS Lambda. This tutorial covers building Lambda apps using the Flogo CLI" href="./flogo-lambda">}}
