Project Flogo provides two different command-line interfaces and which you need depends on the task you need to execute. If you're looking to extend the functionality that Project Flogo offers out of the box, **flogogen** is the tool you want to use. Flogogen generates the scafolding used by extensions (activity/trigger) developers to build new extensions. We'll cover creating new activities and triggers in a separate [chapter](../../extensions-developer).
