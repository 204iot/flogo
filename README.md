Highlights include:
* Ultra-light process engine - 20x-50x lighter than Java or NodeRed
* Extensible & reusable by design to build your own apps, frameworks & platforms 
* Web-based flow modeling & development for end users
* Web-based Step-back Debugger for end users 
* 100% Open Source 

Project Flogo consists of the following sub-projects available as separate repos:
* [flogo-cli](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-cli): A command line tool to build flogo apps 
* [flogo-lib](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-lib): A library to build Flogo extensions
* [flogo-services](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-services): Backing services required by Flogo 
* [flogo-web](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-web) : Web UI to build IoT Integration flows and Flogo apps. Switch to  [0.2-alpha1](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-web/tree/0.2alpha1) branch for an improved install experience
* [flogo-contrib](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-contrib) : Flogo Extensions available out of the box

## Getting Started

**IMPORTANT**: Project Flogo is currently in Developer Preview and primarily addresses the needs of   
- Flogo Extensions developers 
- IoT Solutions Developers 

In other words, currently it is "for developers, by developers". 

As Project Flogo develops and matures, we are considering adding more intgeration tooling and developing zero-code experiences and services for end users based on Project Flogo. If you are an end user or a traditional zero-code integration app developer, we would recommend to check out the videos and sign up for updates on the project to see when it's ready for you to get started.  

If you are an Extensions or IoT Solutions developer, read on because it's easy to get started with Project Flogo:
* To install Flogo Web UI (that includes the runtime) and all dependencies, go to https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-web & follow instructions in the README
* To install just the Flogo CLI and runtime, go to https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-cli & follow instructions in the README
* For extensions developers, visit the docs in this repository to get started with developing your first Flogo activity
